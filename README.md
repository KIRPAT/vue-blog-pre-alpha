# KIRPAT's Vue Blog - Alpha

Hello there! This is my blog, that is in development.

- Frontend Framework: Vue with Vuex. (I will switch to Nuxt later.) 
- CSS: SASS and CSS Grids. I have also used Bootstrap for button and "progrss-bar" styling. 
- JS: ES6 (I'm also thinking of implementing TypeScript at some point.)
- Markup: PUG
